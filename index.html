            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
              <p>I went through primary,high school, then did an Accounting Technician Diploma Course. I really had passion with Accounts since I finished my high school but, due to some personal issues I wasn't able to go directly for the course. Luckily, I did a Certificate Course in Computers in town. I was considered the best student since I was a first leaner and passed highly in my exams at Genieve Computer College.The college manager was pleased with me and took me as an intern in the college. I did expanded my experience in front office desk, record keeping, teaching computers,and performing computer services such as typing,scanning and editing among others. After a while, I had to go for my accounts class in Summit Institute of Professionals. During my study I did my internship at Carolina for Kibera where I helped and learned so much in the Adminstration department. I worked so much in the Reception. Towards the end of my course I got an internship at Milimani Law Courts and worked in the following areas:</p>
